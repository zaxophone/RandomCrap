So I remembered u wanted that server for your mmo, and i dont think it would be good to have it at my house due to a lot of internet downtime so Im going to make a little list of the parts i have here
I could build now, and give it to you whenever. I only have tower cases right now.
You asked for no specs at all. Perfect. Im assuming u mean on top of Windows requirements. Also I can install windows server or windows home or Docker on Ubuntu if you want to go that route.
Windows needs 1ghz or faster processor. Perfect, you can get those for free. 
Windows needs 2gb of ram. A little uncomfortable, especially for a server. In fact, you might want around 8gb (8gb ddr2 is about $50 but i already have a bunch) for a small server. Especially for Windows with all the background stuff, less so for win server.
Windows wants 20gb+ hard drive space. I'll throw in a 160gb boot drive plus a 1tb data drive for $20 total value.
Windows wants a DirectX9 capable graphics card. Thats not reeeeally necessary, I have one from 2004 that can run windows at 480p fine. if you want any higher resolution for setup, I have a $40 Nvidia gts250 that more than meets the requirement.
800x600 display requirement is more than met I assume. None of my cpus actually meet the requirements for windows server 2016 or 2019, so I'll just take the liberty of saying win10 enterprise is your best bet.
anyways, a finished server with the specs above will be worth like $100. U can buy it or lend it or rent it or whatever, if you still want it.
